## Appendix 2: Blogs and resources

There are plenty of websites, blogs and books you can check to read more about microservices and related architectural patterns. The book "Building Microservices, Designing Fine-Grained Systems" by Sam Newman and O’Reilly Media ([http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033158.do](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033158.do)) should be at the top of the top of your list. The most important information has been collected into one place. It is all you need to know to model, implement, test and run new systems using microservices or transform the monolith into a distributed set of smaller applications. A must-have book for every software architect. O’Reilly Media has also released another interesting book, “Microservice Architecture” by Irakli Nadareishvili, Ronnie Mitra, Matt McLarty and Mike Amundsen ([http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920050308.do](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920050308.do)), which is also worth a read.

More on more enterprises are facing the challengre of migrating from the Monolithic architecture towards Headless and Microservices. ["Monolith to Microservices. Evolutionary Patterns to Transform Your Monolith"](https://samnewman.io/books/monolith-to-microservices/) covers most of the technology and organization aspects of such a migration.

With knowledge from Sam Newman, you should be ready to discover websites like[ http://microservices.io](http://microservices.io),[ https://github.com/mfornos/awesome-microservices](https://github.com/mfornos/awesome-microservices) and[ https://dzone.com/](https://dzone.com/) (under „microservices" keyword), curated lists of articles. It’s a Condensed dose of knowledge about core microservice patterns, decomposition methods, deployment patterns, communication styles, data management and many more… There you can also find many interesting presentations and talks recorded at conferences. The last website specifically,[ https://dzone.com/](https://dzone.com/), should be very interesting for IT people.

Depending on your time, you can subscribe to the newsletter "Microservices Weekly" ([http://www.microservicesweekly.com](http://www.microservicesweekly.com)) for a weekly set of articles about architecture and container-based virtualization or visit the Microservices section at the InfoQ website ([https://www.infoq.com/microservices/](https://www.infoq.com/microservices/)), one of the most important websites with articles and talks related to software development.

As you can see, knowledge is all around us. Don’t forget about Martin Fowler and his "Microservice Resource Guide" ([https://martinfowler.com/microservices/](https://martinfowler.com/microservices/)). Martin is Chief Scientist at ToughtWorks, the publisher of “Technology Radar” ([https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar); highly recommended as well) and author of a few bestselling books. Martin Fowler’s wiki is a Mecca for software architects and “Microservice Resource Guide” is only one of them…
