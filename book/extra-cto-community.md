# CTO Community: Interviews, Case Studies and more

Open Source is in the Core of Divante. We belive in sharing: code, knowledge, ideas. Some time ago we started building the community of eCommerce CTOs. Accessing this community gives you a very unique series of interviews, case studies and first and foremost - a place to share the knowledge and thoughts. No strings attached.

## [Interview with Halil Köklü - CTO at LoveCrafts](extra-migrating-towards-headless.md)
Headless eCommerce is a new way of building eCommerce platforms that are ready for agile and fast adaptation to changing market requirements. How to start development with a headless approach?

Halil shares a very unique story of how LoveCrafts decided to migrate from Magento 1 towards headless architecture. How they selected the platform? What was the biggest challenge?

## [Interview with Kelly Goetsch - CPO of commercetools](https://divante.com/webinars/headless-architecture-and-microservices-in-ecommerce-platforms)

This massive shift is caused by unusual changes in the technology landscape. We have access to better, faster, and more agile solutions. On the other hand, many well-known business challenges remain the same. Many technical teams struggle with out-dated, legacy technologies and don’t know where to begin their process of change.

I've discussed how you design the API in the headless era? How the cloud-first platforms can be customized? How important the role of proper org. structure is for the success of microservices architecture?
