This is probably the first Open Source (MIT) book on Micro Services. [Everyone is invited to contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)!

Name a technology conference or meetup and I’ll tell you about the repetitive speech referencing Micro-services. This modern engineering technique has grown from good old SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) with features like REST (vs. old SOAP) support, NoSQL databases and Event driven/reactive approach sprinkled in.

Why have they become so important? Roughly speaking - because of what scale systems achieve nowadays and the number of changes that are deployed on a daily basis. 

**This book is a rather "technical one" - starting with some Business rationale for micro-services and then stepping into engineers’ shoes and trying to show you tools and techniques required to build and scale modern eCommerce systems.**
